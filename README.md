# WikiCraft
A program aiming to be a quick Minecraft wiki [still in development]

Currently: The program shows an overview of all Minecraft updates, ranging from the first official version (1.0) to the most recent (1.17).

The program contains cover art, music and a loading screen.

Coming soon: I plan to make a complete wiki about every block, animal, monster, curiosity and more. I will be launching the program here as I update.

You can already use the latest version of WikiCraft in the releases part.
